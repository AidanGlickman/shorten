    <h1>About srn.pw</h1>
    <p>
      The story of <router-link to="/">srn.pw</router-link> starts with another much simpler site. <a href="https://bcar.fun">bcar.fun</a> was written as a quick n' dirty solution to my high school's messy web infrastructure, which led to students being unable to keep track of important urls. In an effort to fix this problem, I made a simple proxy with redirects to all our schools websites, and a basic frontend to act as a landing page. As my site took off within the school, I realized how useful a tool like this could be in other contexts as well. <router-link to="/">srn.pw</router-link> is what resulted from that realization. <router-link to="/">srn.pw</router-link> is a platform that allows anyone to easily create their own linkbank and share it with the world.
